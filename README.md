# Password Generator Starter Code
Visit site here: https://o7lili.github.io/random-pw-generator/

Using VSCode, this random password generator was created by using starter HTML and CSS code, and JavaScript.
It's a simple site with a button to begin the process of generating a secure password. 
Once the button is clicked, multiple prompts will alert the user to decide how long the password should be (between 8-128 characters), if it should or should not include uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Once all the selections have been made, a password with the chosen criteria will be displayed on the website.
